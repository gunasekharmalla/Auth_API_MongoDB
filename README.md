🔑 API Endpoints
Auth

(→ Register new user with name, email, password, role)

POST /signup
{
  "name": "sample",
  "email": "sample@example.com",
  "password": "pass123",
  "role": "user"
}

→ Login and get JWT

POST /login 
{
  "email": "sample@example.com",
  "password": "pass123"
}

User Routes

GET /profile → Get logged-in user’s profile
(Requires Authorization: Bearer <token>)

GET /users → Get all users (admin only)
(Requires Authorization: Bearer <token>)

DELETE /users/:email → Delete user by email (admin only)

POST /forgot-password -> (user / admin)  get token 

POST /reset-password  -> verify token and give new password via req.body

🔒 Security

Passwords are hashed with bcrypt.
Tokens generated with JWT.
Role-based middleware ensures only admins can access /users & delete routes.
